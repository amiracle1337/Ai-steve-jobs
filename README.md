  3. The response from OpenAI is sent to Eleven Labs where we fetch a custom created clone of Steve's voice
  5. User gets a response back from AI Steve Jobs in the chat field
  6. User plays the audio and heara Steve Jobs read out his answer to you

# Notes
- I had the idea of building something like this in January 2023 before I knew how to code. I've always wanted to personally talk to one of the biggest role models in my life.
- I built this in general Javascript because at the time of coding this, I had yet not learned React yet (which I now do)
