## How it Works:
1. **User Interaction**: Initiate a conversation by posing a question in the chat interface.
2. **OpenAI Integration**: The question is promptly relayed to a pre-configured OpenAI model.
3. **Voice Synthesis with Eleven Labs**: The response from OpenAI is processed by Eleven Labs to replicate Steve Jobs's distinct voice.
4. **Engaging User Experience**: The AI-simulated audio response from Steve Jobs is showcased in the chat interface.
5. **Audio Playback**: Click to revel in the voice of the virtual Steve Jobs as he delivers the answer.

## Prerequisites:
- Secure an OpenAI API key.
- Obtain an Eleven Labs API key.

## Local Deployment:
1. **Repository Setup**: Clone the repository onto your system.
2. **Dependency Installation**: Navigate to the project directory and execute:

```
npm i
```
```
npm start
```

3. **API Key Configuration**: Insert your OpenAI and Eleven Labs API keys in the "env.js" file.

## Personal Reflection:
- I came up with the idea for this project back in January 2023, before knew how to code. I've always wanted to have a chat with Steve Jobs, even if just virtually.
- I used vanilla JavaScript because that's what I was familiar with at the time. I've since learned how to code in React.
